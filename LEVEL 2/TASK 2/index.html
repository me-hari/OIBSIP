                    <b>
                        Stephen Hawking, in full Stephen William Hawking, (born January 8, 1942, Oxford, Oxfordshire,
                        England died March 14, 2018, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), English theoretical physicist whose
                        theory of exploding black holes drew upon both relativity theory and quantum mechanics. He also
                        worked with space-time singularities.

                        Hawking studied physics at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1962), and Trinity Hall, Cambridge
                        (Ph.D., 1966). He was elected a research fellow at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge. In
                        the early 1960s Hawking contracted amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable degenerative
                        neuromuscular disease. He continued to work despite the disease’s progressively disabling
                        effects.


                        Hawking worked primarily in the field of general relativity and particularly on the physics of
                        black holes. In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects
                        containing as much as one billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton. These
                        objects, called mini black holes, are unique in that their immense mass and gravity require that
                        they be ruled by the laws of relativity, while their minute size requires that the laws of
                        quantum mechanics apply to them also. In 1974 Hawking proposed that, in accordance with the
                        predictions of quantum theory, black holes emit subatomic particles until they exhaust their
                        energy and finally explode. Hawking’s work greatly spurred efforts to theoretically delineate
                        the properties of black holes, objects about which it was previously thought that nothing could
                        be known. His work was also important because it showed these properties’ relationship to the
                        laws of classical thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.


                        Hawking’s contributions to physics earned him many exceptional honours. In 1974 the Royal
                        Society elected him one of its youngest fellows. He became professor of gravitational physics at
                        Cambridge in 1977, and in 1979 he was appointed to Cambridge’s Lucasian professorship of
                        mathematics, a post once held by Isaac Newton. Hawking was made a Commander of the Order of the
                        British Empire (CBE) in 1982 and a Companion of Honour in 1989. He also received the Copley
                        Medal from the Royal Society in 2006 and the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. In 2008
                        he accepted a visiting research chair at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in
                        Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
